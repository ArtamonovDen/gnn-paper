\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Within current papper several GNN architectures have been applied to the task of graph classification
in biomedical field and compared results. The following models have been compared: GCN\cite{GCN}, GAT\cite{GAT} and GCNII\cite{GCNII}.
There have been a process of hyperparamets tuning, training and evaluation of models. Mentioned models were applied
to the following biomedical datasets: : \texttt{MUTAG}, \texttt{PROTEINS},
\texttt{ENZYMES}, \texttt{DD},  \texttt{Brain fMRI} and \texttt{Kidney RNASeq}. The result of experiments
were provided in the corresponding section. All code for preparing dataset, model architectures and scripts for 
training and evaluation of neural networks are available in GitHub repository:
